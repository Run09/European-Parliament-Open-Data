# European-Parliament-Open-Data

#### File: meps_full_list_with_twitter_accounts.csv

This file gathers together all the Twitter accounts of the Members of the European Parliament in office.
Please help us keeping it up to date, in order to have a valid instrument for research/political activity/information purposes.

The file contains the name of each MEP, political affiliation, country and the Twitter account.
We are using the list to perform some of the analyses you can find on [ThinkingAboutEU](http://wwww.thinkingabout.eu).

Thank you to [@raimondiand](https://twitter.com/raimondiand) for sharing a list on his blog. We merged it with our list, to produce the (hopefully) complete list we are publishing here. 

NOTE: if you wish to have your account removed from this list, please contact us at info@thinkingabout.eu
